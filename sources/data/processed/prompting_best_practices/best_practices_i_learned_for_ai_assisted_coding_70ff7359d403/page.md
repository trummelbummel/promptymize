Dear developers: Your job is safe, and it actually just got a lot better, too!

A few weeks ago, I took on the task of building an end-to-end LLM app, and I picked up a new tool in my tech stack. I used an AI-powered code editor designed specifically for software engineers like myself to enable us to leverage AI to assist in code generation. And with the help of AI, I was able to deliver a project in a week that would have taken me months! But AI could not have delivered it without me.

Here is what I noticed: Without knowing how to code, I would not have been able to craft the right prompts to generate meaningful code or detect and fix the errors it made. However, because of my extensive background in software engineering and my awareness of coding best practices, I could iterate with an AI assistant on my codebase, using AI as a collaborative tool while I guide it to deliver working and reliable code.

AI-assisted coders today use tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI, or even just copy-pasting code into AI chatbots like ChatGPT, to help them generate code. Before I tried AI Aassisted coding, I was that developer copy-pasting code snippets into ChatGPT to try to speed up my development cycle or debug something. Although this approach did speed up development, it wasn’t effective in the long run because ChatGPT did not have total context on the surrounding code base, or deeply understand my plan for my project. AI integrates deeply with your codebase, allowing developers to write, refactor, and understand code faster using natural language prompts.

As generative language models, LLMs are actually great at code. Why? Because code is a language! So, the underlying mathematical architecture of LLMs built to model human language actually lends itself very well to coding languages as well. However, I notice they still fall short in logical decision-making, such as strategically planning the project, debugging, and sensibly structuring the repo. That is where developers come in to guide them.

There is a difference between **Vibe coding** and **AI-assisted coding**. Let me break it down.

**👎 Vibe coding** is a new approach to software development where, instead of manually typing code, developers use natural language to describe the end product, and the AI handles every step of the technical implementation. This does not require knowledge of software engineering, and I also don’t recommend this approach if the goal is to create working or reliable software.

**👍AI-assisted coding** is different and it’s a step beyond vibe coding. This is a new approach to software development in which programmers primarily interact with LLMs to generate code in an iterative fashion. In this case, the developers are not just focused on the end result of the implementation, but also on hands-on guiding the implementation. This is by far the best approach, and it requires basic foundational knowledge of software engineering.

But the learning curve to become an excellent AI developer is now way shorter. With IDEs for AI assisted coding, anyone can become a great developer and start building high-quality and reliable AI tools themselves. All you need to be an effective AI-assisted coder is a basic knowledge of software engineering best practices and core AI concepts, and you can get all this knowledge from university programs or free online courses. If you want to build AI projects, I recommend knowledge in the following areas, and have linked a few online free courses to help you get started.

* 1–2 coding languages of your choice ([python](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/))
* [Software design principles](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-solid-principles-for-software-design-architecture/)
* [Data Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Joe-Reis-ebook/dp/B0B4VH4T37?ref_=ast_author_mpb)
* [AI Engineering handbook](https://www.amazon.com/LLM-Engineers-Handbook-engineering-production/dp/1836200072/) and online [course building LLM apps](https://decodingml.substack.com/p/master-production-ai-with-our-end?open=false#%C2%A7philoagents-course)

Also, AI Coding tools can teach you how to be a better developer. I said you need to know how to code to be an effective AI-assisted software engineer, but I also want to point out that this tool can be used to jumpstart and accelerate learning to be a good software engineer in the first place. Once you have the foundational understanding from the courses and books above or similar, you can start coding with AI assistance and continue your learning journey through that experience.

## Best Practices for Effective AI-Assisted Coding beyond Vibe Coding

After completing my first AI-assisted coding project, I’ve gathered some valuable insights about how to properly use an AI coding assistant. I discovered some personal best practices that will help me ensure the code I deliver is still reliable code delivery while still improving my efficiency with AI assistance. There are both right and wrong ways to do this. Let me break it down.

## Prompt Engineering

One of the most effective ways to maximize the benefits of using an AI Coding Assistant like the one in Cursor is to master prompt engineering. I quickly discovered that the more specific and detailed my prompts were, the better the code the AI would produce.

**🔹 Be specific:** Instead of making vague requests like “write a function for X,” I learned to articulate precisely what I wanted: “write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns only the even numbers.” If the first suggestion wasn’t quite right, I would refine my prompt by adding more context or asking follow-up questions. AI code generation thrives on clarity; the more information you provide, the more effectively it responds.

**🔹Include examples:** Another useful tactic is incorporating code examples, comments, or docstrings into your prompts. Adding annotations like this with your detailed descriptions can guide it in implementing or expanding upon your ideas. I often wrote out the logic in comments or pseudo-code first and then asked the AI assistant to convert those comments into functional code. This approach not only improved the readability of the code but also helped ensure that the AI’s output aligned with my intentions.

**🔹Use your engineering skillset:** Additionally, using true engineering terminology is critical. Understanding the language of your craft, regardless of what it is, will enable you to accurately describe your requirements and guide AI in generating the desired output. Prompt engineering is a skill; the more proficient you become at discussing what you’re trying to create in precise technical terms and details, the more successful you will be at collaborating with AI to produce something great.

## Pair Programming Mindset

The best way to work with an AI coding assistant is to treat it like another developer on your team. The most productive sessions happened when I engaged in a back-and-forth workflow, asking it to generate code, reviewing the results, and inquiring about the reasoning for its design choices, then refining either the prompt or the code as needed. This collaborative approach brought out the best in both myself and the AI.

I also made it a habit to ask the AI coding assistant “why” questions when uncertain about its suggestions. Requesting explanations not only helped me learn but also allowed me to catch mistakes or misunderstandings or identify similar solutions before they became problematic. The more I collaborated with the coding assistant, the more I realized that the future of software development relies on teamwork between humans and AI.

## Plan your Project and Codebase

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is the necessity of having a plan before starting to code with AI. It may be tempting to simply open your AI tool and request it to build a feature or even an entire app by describing the end product, but this approach can lead to total chaos and a codebase you don’t understand and can’t build on or maintain. While AI is powerful, without a clear idea of how you would structure the code yourself, you risk ending up with a jumble of disconnected snippets that fail to integrate as the codebase matures.

So before I typed a single prompt or generated any code, I took the time to map out the modules, data flow, and responsibilities of each component of my app. This blueprint guided the AI, making the entire process smoother and more productive. This approach allows you to maintain control over the architecture and ensures that each piece aligns with your overall plan. And this is one of the reasons we still need developers.

*🔍 Pro tip: AI works best at solving tiny, discrete tasks. You need to design the problem first.*

## Build Iteratively

Building iteratively is the key to any successful coding project, and AI-assisted projects are no exception. I quickly learned that trying to generate too much code at once often leads to confusion, bugs, and wasted time. Instead, I focused on constructing my app piece by piece, validating each part before moving on to the next.

This incremental approach made it easy to catch mistakes early, adapt to new requirements, and maintain a clean codebase. Each time I finished a small chunk, I would test and review it before proceeding to the next task. This method not only simplified debugging but also provided me with a sense of progress and momentum and good checkpoints in github.

Keeping things simple is equally important. The more complex your prompt or code structure, the more likely the AI is to become confused or produce unexpected results. I found that by concentrating on one function or module at a time, I could guide the AI to generate high-quality code that met my needs and adhered to my vision for the implementation plan. If I ever felt stuck, I would break the problem down even further.

*🔍 Pro tip: Developer flow. Use o3-mini for debugging and gpt-4-turbo reasoning for live.*

## Refactor! Refactor! Refactor!

While using an AI assistant to code my project, I often took breaks from building new features to step back and refactor the existing codebase. Refactoring is not just a best practice; it’s a necessity when working with AI-assisted code. Early in my project, everything was confined to a single main file, which quickly became unwieldy and represented spaghetti. No one likes spaghetti code! So I made it a point to refactor before completing the project, breaking the code into logical modules and cleaning up as I progressed. Routine, periodic cleanups helped prevent the codebase from becoming overly complex or disorganized, making it much easier to maintain. Each time I added a new feature or fixed a bug, I would take a moment to look for opportunities to simplify and organize the code. This not only made the code easier to work with but also enabled the AI to generate helpful suggestions as we continued to build out the codebase. In the end, a well-structured codebase is the foundation for successful AI-assisted development, and it’s important that the human developer has communicated a clear vision for this structure and ensures the AI-generated code adheres to that vision. This is an example of how AI-assisted coding can be more than just vibe coding and results in better quality software products.

If you’re looking for a guide for building clean reusable code, I love Miguel’s take [here](https://theneuralmaze.substack.com/p/building-agent-projects-without-losing).

It is also important to review your code together with your AI assistant for overall quality. After a significant refactor, I prompted it to evaluate my code and provide a report. This feedback was invaluable in designing the codebase and keeping it orgnaized in a way that was maintainble, easy to debug, and facilitated colaboration.
